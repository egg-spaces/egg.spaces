###Who the heck are we?

Dev Bros (aka eggdevelopers) is a discord community dedicated to providing new developers and designers a place to grow, be curious and make mistakes, while providing a platform for more experience developers to share their knowledge and cultivate the next generation of good eggs.

###What the heck is this?

Dev Bros was looking for a place to share information in the form of questions and links, so we checked out Google Spaces. But then Google Spaces died.

Rather than pursue other existing solutions, we decided to build this discussion and learning forum on our own, completely from scratch, as an exercise in git, web development, graphic design, web design, project maintenence, project management, and (most importantly) teamwork.
